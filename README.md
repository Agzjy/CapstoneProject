# CapstoneProject - Diseases Prediction
We aim to create a model to assist healthcare providers with patientsâ€™ diagnoses.

For now, we have implemented different models to be trained on the ground truth pathology. Please refer to `predict_pathology` folder.

### Requirments:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: By default, CPU version of Pytorch is installed. If you like to use GPU version, please refer to https://pytorch.org/
