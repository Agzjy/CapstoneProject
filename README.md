# CapstoneProject - Diseases Prediction

## Introduction:

In the field of healthcare, the integration of machine learning technologies has played an important role, particularly in the realm of disease diagnosis and management. A good machine learniong model can shorten the time spent on diagnosis thus better support the treatment.
Our group aim to find better models with higher prediction accuracy to assist healthcare providers with patientsâ€™ diagnoses.
For now, we have implemented different models to be trained on the ground truth pathology and differential diagnosis. Please refer to `predict_pathology` and `predict_differential_diagnosis` folder.
